# Clickable Phone Numbers
A Firefox extension built with JavaScript in the [Jetpack Add-on Builder](http://builder.mozillalabs.com) that makes all phone numbers on the web into links and automatically connects your mobile or land line phone to the number using [Twilio](http://www.twilio.com).

# Files

clickable-phone-numbers.xpi is an installable Firefox extension.

# Background

Built at [Mozilla Summit 2010](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Summit2010) in a very short time, this could be done much better. It works!
